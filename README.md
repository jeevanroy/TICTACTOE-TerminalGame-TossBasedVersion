TIC TAC TOE: 
A terminal Game. 
Game logic runs based on the toss winner.
The game logic iterates for 9 times since there are 9 inputs both the users can provide to the play the game.
The numberpad on the keyborad is considered as the 3 by 3 grid (1-9).

The toss winner will be asked first to choose either X or O.
The toss winner can choose either X or O but the loser will be alloted the left one.

Toss winner will start the game.
Then game continues until someone wins or Tie.

GAME LOGIC:
1st you will be asked that are you ready to play? y or n:
If you enter n you will come out of the game. You will come to the actual terminal.
If you enter y the game will ask for the player names.
After entering your names a random toss will be done.
Winner will be displayed on the screen. With a little cheer-up to the one who was defeated.
He can choose either X or O.
He will be asked to provide a position to put his X or O on the board.
now 1st iteration is DONE.
Then the other guy will be asked to provide a position to put his O or X on the board.
now 2nd iteration is DONE.
Like this it goes upto 9th interation if nobody won.
If somebody won at any number of iteration then greetings will be displayed on the output. With a little cheerup to the one who was defeated.

The game continues only if you provide the expected input.
  
The game logic is PRECISSE, ACCURATE & PERFECT!
